# Megical backend example

1. Configure private key

   OPEN_ID_CLIENT_KEY in `./dotenv/easyaccess-development.env`

2. Install dependencies

   `npm install`

3. Run watch

   `npm run watch`

4. Open url

   http://127.0.0.1:8765

   localhost or ip needs different openid client so they won't work.
